wicked-robot
============

* wickedrobot.pl

An "action-bot" written in Perl for Linux &amp; Windows,
that provides it's own server.
It listens on a port and checks incoming
messages against an action-file,
so it is possible to define actions, and run them
on demand when you need them.
The wickedclient.pl is just an example how messages
can be communivated to the server.

* phibot (&#934;bot)

The phibot is an bot for an irc-channel. As like the wickedrobot,
you can order him commands.
