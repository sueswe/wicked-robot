## phibot (&#966;bot) 

The phibot is a bot for an irc-channel.  
As like the wickedrobot, you can order him commands,  
but within a chat-session on an irc-server.  

Just configure the actions.rc file for your commands,  
edit the phibot.pl (servername, channelname) and  
start it ("perl phibot.pl").  

You can install one centralized bot, or you can  
also configure your own bot,  
just change the nickname und loginname in the phibot.pl  
and start it on your computer.  




## wickedrobot.pl #

    (alpha-state)

An "action-bot" written in Perl for Linux &amp; Windows,  
that provides it's own server.  
It listens on a port and checks incoming  
messages against an action-file,  
so it is possible to define actions, and run them  
on demand when you need them.  
The wickedclient.pl is just an example how messages  
can be communicated to the server.
